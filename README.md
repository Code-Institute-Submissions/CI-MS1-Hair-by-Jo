## Description

The Hair by Jo project was designed to provide my sister with a website where she is able to demonstrate her work and increase the number of enquiries made. By creating a website with a method of easily contacting her, this will hopefully make the process of getting an appointment easier, which will ultimately increase business.



## User Stories

* "I want to easily understand the main purposes of the site and learn more about the business"
* "I want to be able to navigate throughout the site easily and find services and prices on offer"
* "I want to be able to access the website using my mobile device as this is what I would frequently use to access this type of service"
* "I want to be able to see testimonials to see what her customers think of Jo and see that she is trusted"
* "I want to locate social media links to see visual representations of her work"
* "I want to easily be able to contact Jo and find out availability for an appointment"
* "I want to know that the business is working inline with current government guidelines surrounding COVID"



## Market Research

I decided to carry out B2C interviews with customers to find out what makes a good UX and what information and features they would like to see on the website.



All of this information was used when designing the layout, colour scheme, typography, imagery and features that were deployed on the final website and contributed to the above User Stories.



## UX and Features

The website was designed mainly for a female demographic of all ages, however with the male customer also in mind. It was designed to be a simple, yet effective website which clearly demonstrated examples of Jo's work and ways to contact her.



#### 1. Strategy

The aim of the project was to increase the number of enquiries made with the business by providing a simple and clean UX which was user-friendly. An increased number of enquiries will hopefully lead to more business.



##### Business Goals

* Increase the number of enquiries made
* Increase the number of followers on social media accounts
* Provide up-to-date information about the services and prices of the business
* Provide evidence that the business is operating safely throughout the COVID crisis
* Demonstrate examples of work to show customers what the finished product looks like
* Create an overall positive UX for customers by providing a simple, yet effective website



##### Customer Goals

* Easy to find contact information to make enquiries

* Easy to find links to social media accounts to follow and also see examples of work

* Easy to access information about services and prices on offer

* Evidence that the business is operating in-line with COVID guidelines

* Easy to find gallery to highlight examples of work carried out

* Mobile-first design as this is likely the most frequent way of finding and researching the business

  

#### 2. Scope

The scope of the project and features to include were influenced by the market research carried out with customers. It should be a mobile-first website that is responsive on all devices.



##### Current Features

* ###### Navigation Bar

  * Large font used to make finding and distinguishing different pages easy
  * Responsive navigation bar that condenses down to an icon on smaller devices
  * Contact form modal which is linked to all pages and useable on all devices to increase enquiries
  * Logo and h1 tag clickable across all pages to link back to the main home page

  

* ###### Home Page

  * Book an appointment button to act as a clear and immediate call to action to increase enquiries
  * Basic animated hero image to enhance overall UX
  * Small about me section to quickly express Jo's experience and qualifications and a brief overview of services offered
  * Link to services and prices page so customers are easily able to find what information they need

* ###### Services Page

  * Easy to read list of all services and prices on offer
  * Clear explanation and assurance that the business is working through within government COVID guidelines
  * Picture of the salon so customers are able to see the environment they would be potentially visiting 
    * This disappears on mobile devices for better UX
    * The services/prices and COVID guidelines were more important to display

  

* ###### Gallery Page

  * Simple and responsive layout that clearly shows some work that Jo has carried out
  * A number of pictures included clearly demonstrate protective gowns and facemasks being worn due to COVID
  * Mixture of pictures used that highlight different hair styles on offer

* ###### Testimonials Page

  * Clear examples of recent testimonials from customers and where they are from

* ###### Footer

  * Clear indication of where the business is located and ways to contact Jo
  * Links to social media accounts to demonstrate work and increase following



* ###### Site Wide Alert

  * Alert across all pages, located at the top with a phone number so customers are easily able to contact Jo



* ###### Banner

  * Banner across all pages which highlights key things a customer would want to see such as 'COVID Compliant', 'Over 23 Years of Experience' and 'Highly Rated'
    * This condenses down to one when viewed on mobile devices for better UX
    * 'COVID Compliant' was chosen as the one to display as it was important given the current circumstances



#### 3. Structure

The site was designed to have essential pages which are Home, Services, Gallery, Testimonials and a Contact modal which was gathered using B2C research. The same navigation bar and footer was used across all pages for consistency and better IXD.



Short and easy to read paragraphs were used to easily get essential information across to customers. A call to action was included on the home page to make it easy to contact the business as the ultimate goal was to increase the number of enquiries.



A selection of quality images were used to be engaging and provide clear examples of work and the salon where the business is.



A footer with clear ways of contacting the business and links to the social media was used to again ultimately increase the number of enquiries and following on social media.



A modal contact form which is linked to all pages and useable on all devices to increase enquiries.



#### 4. Skeleton

* Wireframe was created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

###### Testimonials Page

#### 5. Surface

##### Design

* ###### Colour Scheme

  * The main colour used throughout the website is a dark blue (#1D3557) which provide a slick and professional look
  * This was combined with white (#fff), black (#000) and yellow (#ffd700) to make all text stand out

* ###### Typography

  * Laila was used as the main font throughout the website as it is rounded and easy to read across all devices. Serif was used as a backup font should the primary one not load

* ###### Imagery

  * The home page used a black and white image which was animated to provide and engage users
  * An image of the salon was used on the services pages to show customers the environment in which they may be visiting
  * A collection of different images were used on the gallery page to demonstrate some of the work that was recently carried out and also demonstrate that safety measures in place due to COVID
  * Two images on the home page under the hero image demonstrate Jo's work she has done for various hairdressing competitions

* ###### Icons

  * Icons across the website were sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), which provided visual indications of what the section was about



## Future Improvements

* Form submission to be functional
* Implement a booking system, whereby a customer is able to directly book in and see the diary rather than having to make an enquiry first
* Improve the level of detail in terms of the types of products used
* Create additional pages that highlight different aspects of work specifically (Hair extensions/Bridal) and other products that are able to be sold to customers
* Create a live feed for Instagram and Facebook that automatically update photos that are on display on the website
* Create a mailing list for customers that can include offers and discounts on treatments, but also provide an easy way of communicating with all customers. With the continuous changes surrounding COVID, an easy way of communicating changes to customers would be useful.



## Changes

A number of changes were made after the initial wireframe was created, these include:

* Animated hero image was include with some overlay text rather than three static circular images. This was changed as it felt more engaging and would lead to an increased number of enquiries
* Carousel was meant to be included on the Gallery page, but there was some difficulty with the actual coding of it and I experienced a number of issues around this, so I decided to change to a simple thumbnail gallery format which clearly demonstrates a number of different types of styles and safety guidelines in one go
* Colour scheme was changed to a navy blue as this felt more slick and professional
* Added additional images to home page to make it more appealing and show off some additional competition work that Jo carried out
